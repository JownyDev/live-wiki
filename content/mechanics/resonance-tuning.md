The art of harmonizing one's own bio-rhythms with an Echo Crystal to retrieve stored memories or manipulate local gravity fields.

## Rules
1.  **Calibration:** The user must listen to the crystal's base frequency for 10 minutes.
2.  **Harmonization:** The user hums or plays a counter-tone.
3.  **Effect:** On success, the crystal glows and projects a holographic memory or levitates small objects.
4.  **Failure:** Discordant feedback causes nausea and temporary deafness.
