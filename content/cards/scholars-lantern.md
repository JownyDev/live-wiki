A modified mining lamp that uses a shard of **Echo Crystal** instead of a battery. It emits a light that reveals sound waves as visible ripples in the air.

**Effect:** Allows the user to see "Sound Shadows" – lingering acoustic imprints of past conversations in a room.
**Rarity:** Unique. Hand-crafted by Elara Vance.

> "To see the past, one must first learn to listen to the light." - Elara Vance's notes.
