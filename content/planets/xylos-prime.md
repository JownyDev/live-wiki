A shattered world of floating crystalline islands, held together by a magnetic anomaly known as "The Core Song". The sky is a perpetual twilight of violet and shifting auroras.

## Geography
The planet is not a single sphere but a cluster of tectonic shards orbiting a central, blinding singularity. Gravity varies by island, and travel is achieved through light-bridges or gravitational gliders.

## Climate
The atmosphere is thin and charged with static. Storms of glass-dust are common, requiring protective gear for any biological entities.
