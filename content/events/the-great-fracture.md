The cataclysmic event that shattered the crust of Xylos Prime. Originally believed to be a natural tectonic shift, recent theories by scholars like **Elara Vance** suggest it was a resonance cascade event triggered by unauthorized mining of the Core Song.

## Consequences
*   **Physical:** 70% of the planet's surface became uninhabitable or lost to deep space.
*   **Cultural:** The "Silence" era began, where music was banned for fear of triggering further quakes.
*   **Ecological:** The emergence of crystalline flora that feeds on static electricity.

Elara was a child during this event and claims to remember the "song" that played just before the ground broke.
